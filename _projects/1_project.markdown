- OntoSQL is a Java-based tool issued from Inria research, in the OAK then CEDARteams. It provides two main functionalities :
    - Loading RDF graphs (consisting of data triples and possibly a schema or ontology) into a relational data-base ; the data will be integer-encoded and indexed.
    - Querying the loaded data through conjunctive RDF queries. OntoSQL not only evaluates queries, it answer them,  that  is  :  its  answers  include  data  explicitly  present  in  the  database,  as  well  as  data  that  is  only implicitly in the database, and which is due to the explicit data and to the ontology.
